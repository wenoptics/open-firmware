# How to find Scribit's point zero?

3 years ago Updated

**Warning:** while the Auto Calibration has been released in BETA, we still **recommend that you tag your Zero Point** to always have a visual reference of where your Scribit will rest before and after any drawing.  

Your Scribit Zero Point is the point **where any drawing or erasing program will start from.**

**2 things** to know before starting: 

**A)** if your installation area is **between 2m x 2m / 6’7” x 6’7”** and **2.75m x 2.75m / 9’ x 9’** you will have to look for the **A1-A2** holes when using the Scribit Measuring Tape to find the Zero Point.

**B)** If your installation area is **between 3m x 3m / 10’ x 10’** and **4m x 4m / 13’2” x 13’2”** you will have to look for the **B1-B2** holes when using the Scribit Measuring Tape to find the Zero Point.

In both cases, you have to take your pencil, extend the Scribit Measuring Tape towards the ground vertically and bend it with a 90° angle in correspondence of your A1/B1 hole, then mark the position of your A2/B2 hole.

It is much easier to check the video below for this part of the process.
